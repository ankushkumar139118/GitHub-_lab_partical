Git branching creates an independent line of development, 
allowing developers to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. It acts as a lightweight,
movable pointer to a snapshot of changes, enabling parallel work and safer collaboration.
Once complete, these branches can be merged back into the main branch
